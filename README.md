# EDA-on-Heart-disease-Analysis
This is Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Disease Dataset using Python and it's libraries

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. As we embark on this health analysis journey, the goal is not only to interpret the data at hand but also to translate these insights into actionable recommendations that can positively influence health policies, personalized healthcare approaches, and, ultimately, the well-being of individuals and communities.

This Dataset consist of 1025 rows and 14 columns:
Columns and Their datatypes:
Numerical:
   Age,
   Resting BP,
   Cholesterol,                          
   Resting ECG ,
   Max heartrate,
   ST Depression

Categorical:
   Fasting blood Sugar,
   angina,
   Slope ST Segment,
   ca,
   Thalassemia,                                       
   Target,
   Sex,
   Chest pain.

As a Health Data Analyst my main objective for this analysis includes:
    						1. Cleaning and Transformation of Data
								2. Number of patients diagnosed with heart disease.
								3. Distribution of diseased patients based on gender.
								4. Analysis concerning age:
											1. Gender-specific impact of age on cholesterol levels.
											2. Influence of age on blood pressure.
											3. Relationship between heart rate and age among diseased patients.
							 5. Examination of diseased patients with respect to categorical features:
										1. Resting Electrocardiogram (ECG)'.
										2. Presence of angina.
										3. Slope of ST segment.
										4. Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy('ca').
                    5. Type of thalassemia.
                    6. Chest pain type.
                    7. Fasting blood sugar levels
